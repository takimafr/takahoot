Kahoot is this very cool tool to create quizzes and trivia for educational (or any other) purposes. Once the admin has setup all the questions, any player can just join the game and answer using a phone or any device that has a decent browser. What is Takahoot? Well, we love Kahoot, we just thought that a phone was too \"common\" of a device to be fun. So we made a target and bought nerf guns to replace it and answer all the questions while shooting. Simple enough isn't it? Although this may seem easy , it actually means that we: * Conceived and Modelized every piece in 3D * Used 3D printers to print some of the parts * Used Laser-cutting machines to create the rest of the parts * Found and assembled the right electronics and sensors * Created an Arduino software + binary serial protocol to handle target-logic * Developed the main software UI to launch and control the games from your computer We are very proud of this project and hope it can be useful to create a more ludic way of learning. About this doc This documentation will allow you to get started on the use of your own takahoot devices. It also contains a Maker guide which will allow you to create your own device from scratch. Don't want to bother buying and printing / cutting materials? Contact-us and we will find a way to do that for you and send you the whole kits ready to assemble. Contributors A big Thanks to Takima who sponsored us and invested much time and efforts into helping to make this project a reality. Thanks to Nicolas Thierion for coming up with the original idea, and to the lead contributors of the project: * Alexandre Nunesse - Kahoot API, Target fixes Takahoot Client * Logan Lepage - Takahoot UI Client * Lo\u00efc Ortola - Target design making, Hardware Arduino","title":"The Project"},{"location":"#takahoot-targets-for-kahoot-games","text":"","title":"Takahoot - Targets for Kahoot Games"},{"location":"#what-is-kahoot","text":"Kahoot is this very cool tool to create quizzes and trivia for educational (or any other) purposes.

Although they work on different topics on a daily basis, they all like driving themselves beyond their comfort zone. Most developers are good at web programming, and we get better at doing large-scale architectures every day. The tradeoffs of this is that people get disconnected from the low-level universe. We love making stuff that blinks, interacts in reality, and that is not just software. Why? Because it requires a whole new approach (gravity, electronics hardware design, properties of materials, heat, sensitivity, inter-operability, etc...) and brings very interesting challenges we just don't see anywhere else. It also was a unique opportunity to really do it from scratch : from the 3D design to the making, assembly, driver, and client. The Sponsors A big Thanks to Takima who sponsored us and invested much time and efforts into helping to make this project a reality. They also took care of all the materials required for prototype design, fablab fees, and even 3D printing plastics. It is an awesome company, you should look it up and try to join us :)","title":"About Us"},{"location":"about/#about-us","text":"","title":"About Us"},{"location":"about/#the-dev-team","text":"Lo\u00efc, Alex and Logan have been working together for years at Takima.
